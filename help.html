						<strong>Metabolic Interactive Nodular Network for Omics (MINNO)</strong> is a <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank"><span>D3 javascript library</span></a> based web application to visualize biological data onto metabolic networks. Besides visualization, this tools offer various ways to share data and results to facilitate collaboration across multiple research groups globally. Being a web-application, it does not require any installation and it can be run on both Chrome and Mozilla browsers.
						
						<br><br>
						
						The tool accepts any kind of omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and fluxomics data as long as they can be visualized by changing sizes of nodes and edges of the metabolic network. The modular design promotes accelerated investigation of omics data on genome-scale metabolic networks for multiple species.
						
						<br><br>
						
						<a class="offset" name="databases"></a> 
						<strong2>Databases:</strong2>
						<br><br>
						MINNO utilize two biological databases: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and National Center for Biotechnology Information- Reference Sequence (NCBI-RefSeq) database.
						
						<ol>
							<li><a href="https://www.kegg.jp/" target="_blank"><span><strong>KEGG-Database:</strong></span></a> Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. MINNO comes with 66 base metabolic pathways from the KEGG database, which cover all primary metabolic pathways and can be combined together to build any possible large-scale metabolic network as needed.
							</li>
							
							<br>
							
							<li> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank"><span><strong>NCBI-RefSeq database:</strong></span></a> The NCBI-Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcripts, and proteins. It is an open access collection of publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein products. MINNO enables users to built organism specific metabolic map by constructing large-scale metabolic network using annotated gene sequences from NCBI-RefSeq database.  </li>

							  Download sample dataset
							</a>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Part 1: Downloading the ortholog network:</strong> 
									<br>
									
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li>Download the sample dataset and save in a new folder.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Click the "Simulation ON" button, which will update to display "Simulation OFF" that will retain the (X,Y) coordinates of the network layout. To access network files, click on the drop-down menu labeled 'KEGG Database'. </li> 
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 00-56-58.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> Enter 'Arginine biosynthesis' in the search bar and choose 'Arginine Biosynthesis' from the Selected Ortholog Maps category.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 00-57-37.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>Click on the Select Rxns drop-down menu and click 'Select All'. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 00-57-54.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> Now, the Arginine Biosynthesis network should be visible. You can adjust the position of the network on the screen by dragging it with your cursor. Additionally, you can zoom in or out using the scroll function on your mouse. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 00-58-21.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> To export the network in JSON format, right-click on the screen. From the options that appear, select "Export," then choose "Network," and finally click on "JSON." Save the exported file in JSON format in the same folder as the sample dataset. This is an ortholog or base network  file. It is important to save the file with the prefix "Ortholog_ko_". MINNO tool will automatically suggest a suitable name for the file, and it is recommended to use the suggested name. If the file name already exists, you can add a convenient suffix to differentiate it. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 00-58-44.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
									</ol>
								</li>
								
								<li><strong>Part 2: Downloading the organism network:</strong> 
								<br>
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li> Now, click on the "KEGG Organisms" list drop-down menu. Search for "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" and select PA01 strain.  </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-00-27.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>After selecting the specific species strain (PA01), we need to specify the metabolic pathway. Click on the "KEGG Database" drop-down menu and search for "Arginine Biosynthesis". Under the "List of Pathways" category, select "Arginine biosynthesis". </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 08-36-53.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>A new window will pop up with an XML file. This is the KGML file from the KEGG database titled "Arginine biosynthesis" of organism "pae", which is the KEGG ID for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Right-click on the file and select the "Save as" option to save the file in the same folder as the other files. </li>
										<br>
										<li> Now, upload the XML file that you just saved. If the "Simulation ON" option is active, the nodes of the network will self-organize based on the D3.js library. If not, the network will remain static. Right-click on the screen and select "Export > Network > JSON". This is an organism-specific KEGG file. The file name should have the prefix "KEGG_org_" where "org" represents the organism ID. MINNO tool will automatically suggest a suitable name for the file, and it is recommended to use the suggested name. If the file name already exists, you can add a convenient suffix to differentiate it. Save this file in your tutorial folder. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-03-08.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
									</ol>
								</li>
								
								<li><strong>Part 3: Combining the ortholog and organism specific network/s:</strong> 
								<br>
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li> Refresh MINNO, ensuring that the simulation is off to prevent any alterations to the network layout due to node movements. Right-click and select Import > Network. Choose both the Ortholog and KEGG networks you created in the folder (in .json format only). Wait for the reaction menu to update with the newly uploaded files. Click on Select Rxns > Select all, and the network will appear on the screen. All the annotated reactions for the PA01 metabolic network in the KEGG database will be displayed as nodes connected by black lines/edges, while unannotated reactions will be represented by light grey lines/edges between nodes. Right-click to export this file in JSON format as before, and save it as "KEGG_pae_Arginine biosynthesis_combined.json" in your tutorial folder. You can choose any arbitrary name as long as it allows you to identify it as the Arginine biosynthesis network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-04-01.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
									</ol>
								</li>
								
								<li><strong>Part 4: Adding reactions to the network:</strong>
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li> In case you need to add a reaction for the transport of extracellular metabolites such as L-Arginine, right-click on the screen and select Insert > Reaction.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-04-25.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> To view the reaction node name, click on the Grid, Tooltip drop-down menu and unselect "Reaction node name." This will display the reaction names.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-05-52.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> Double-click on the text beside the new reaction nodes to change their names. For the grey reaction node, change the name to "L-Arginine outflux," and for the white metabolite node, change the name to "L-Arginine." You do not need to change the Subsystem or gene names, but you can add them to your future visualizations if desired. 
										</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-07-32.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> Click and drag to re-arrange the reaction node so that the white metabolite node is on top of the reaction node. For alignment, press the SHIFT key and drag your cursor over the nodes from L-Arginine down to N-acetyl-L-citrulline in the original network. Once those nodes are all highlighted in green, release the SHIFT key and right-click. From the menu, select Geometric operations > Alignment > Vertical. This will align the selected nodes vertically. If you make a mistake with the alignment, you can use the right-click menu to select the Undo option. 
										</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-08-16.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>To connect your new outflux reaction to the rest of the network, hold down the CTRL key and left-click on the L-Arginine node of the original network. Then, while still holding CTRL, drag your cursor to the L-Arginine outflux grey reaction node and release the mouse button. A black line connecting the two nodes will appear. If you accidentally drag over some text while performing this step, you may need to repeat the process to ensure the connection is made correctly. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-08-38.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>Export this new network by right-clicking on the screen and selecting Export > Network > JSON. Save the file in your tutorial folder with the name "KEGG_pae_Arginine biosynthesis_combined_rxn.json". After saving, refresh your browser and click on the Simulation ON button to preserve the network layout. Next, re-upload your new network file by selecting Import > Network from the right-click menu. Choose the JSON file you just saved and then select all the reactions under the Select Rxns menu. The network with your outflux reaction should now appear. Note that by default, only the metabolite node names are displayed, but you can un-select "Reaction node names" on the Grid, Tooltip drop-down menu to view or edit the reaction names.  </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-09-04.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
									</ol>
								</li>
								
								<li><strong>Part 5: Uploading data to the network:</strong> 
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li> Right-click on the screen and select Import > Datafile. Choose the tutorial datafile that you saved at the beginning. To classify different metabolite nodes based on their groups, press and hold the SHIFT key, and then drag your cursor over the intracellular nodes, excluding the recently added L-Arginine node. Once the desired nodes are highlighted in green, right-click on the screen and select Select > Node from the menu.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-09-30.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>Click on the Group drop-down menu, which is currently displaying "extracellular". Select "intracellular" from the menu. Then, left-click on the network screen to deselect those nodes. Repeat the same process for the extracellular node, which is the L-Arginine node that you added manually. Make sure to only highlight the white metabolite node, not the grey reaction node. From the Group drop-down menu, select "extracellular". </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 08-46-07.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										
										<li> To normalize the data for each group, click on the Methods drop-down menu. It should currently be displaying "None". Then, click on "Control Normalization" under the extracellular subheading.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 08-50-46.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li> Next, click on the Parameters drop-down menu and select "scaling". Drag the larger slider bar to your desired scaling value, in this case, 2. Repeat this process for the intracellular subheading by selecting "Control Normalization". To register the scaling factor, slide the bar away from 2, release it, and then slide it back to 2 again. Remember to adjust the parameters for each group separately. Under the Link Group section, select "None". For the scaling value, adjust it to 1 as these data are already normalized and do not require additional normalization steps. </li>
										
										<br>
										
										<li>Now, click on "Invert" on the color bar at the bottom of the menu. This will make blue color represent low values while red color represent high values. Please note that for your own visualizations, you can choose any color scheme from the color-scheme drop-down menu that suits your preferences.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-37-34.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>To visualize the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) data, click on the menu at the top of the screen that currently displays "PA" and select "SA" instead. The nodes on the screen that have SA data should now be colored accordingly, and the outflux reaction should have a bolded arrow indicating the flux. You can follow the same instructions to access the S. aureus data on a different tab in your browser and display the data there. This way, you can compare the data from both species at each time point. </li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 09-22-32.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>To change the timepoint to 6hr, select the menu that currently displays "12hr" and choose "6hr" instead. This will update the visualization to show the data for the selected timepoint. For cleaner final visualizations, you can select "Link node" from the Grid, Tooltip drop-down menu. This will remove the grey link nodes from your network, while still keeping the white metabolite nodes visible. This can enhance the clarity of your network visualization.</li>
										<br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2022-09-28 01-39-19.png" width=750 />
										<br><br>
										<li>To practice some of these features, you can try adding another reaction to the network. First, refresh your browser to remove any existing data from the network. Then, follow the same steps you used to add the L-Arginine outflux reaction to add an L-Glutamine outflux reaction. This will allow you to explore the process and familiarize yourself with adding reactions to the network. It's worth noting that this program contains many more features beyond the scope of this basic tutorial. If you're interested, I recommend reading through the instruction manual to discover additional features that can further customize your networks and enhance your experience with the tool. </li>

										<li>
										User can adjust the font size of the labels by selecting font menu option and slider the smaller bar at the bottom. User can adjust the numerical range on both sides which can go upto +/-1000. 
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-10-03.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										User can delete unwanted nodes in the network by first select specific nodes and then delete->only selected. 
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-10-52.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-11-32.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										User can turn grey link to dark by highlighting them. First select nodes (both metabolite nodes and reactions nodes) that needed to be highlighted. Then in the menu under Geometric operations->Highlight.
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-12-05.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-13-35.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										User can also make circular arc by using make arc function. First select only nodes (both metabolite nodes and reactions nodes) that you want them to be connected using arc. Then go to the menu under Geometric operations->Make arc.
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-25-04.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										User can then add the additional transport reactions as shown earlier.
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-29-57.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										User can add the rectangle to represent cell membrane or wall. This option appears in the insert->rectangle. The newly added rectangle will be add top of the network which will hide the network. To push it back, go to the Geometric operations->Layer->Push to back. This will push the rectangle behind the network. Additional attributes of rectangle can be adjusted such as roundness of corners, border thickness from the menu which had font option. Range can be adjusted as usual. To change background color, first select the rectangle. The selected rectangle will looks like green with two red circles on the diagonal. These circles allow user to adjust the size of the rectangle. Once the rectangle is selected, slide the black strip on the color scale. User can choose colors from various color scales in the color scales menu at the bottom.
										</li>
										<img src="images/Screenshot from 2023-07-31 11-33-04.png" width=750 /> <br><br>
										<li>
										This is the final network visualization of the data looks like.

					<strong2>Datafile Schema:</strong2></a> 
					<br><br>
					The datafile needs to be in .csv. Each datafile format have information of variables/conditions which are varied and quantitative measurements of various biomolecules which are represented as nodes or edges in the network. Below are the steps to make datafile:
					<br><br>
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							 Assuming three variables which are varied to be ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘Z’ where 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' can be any arbitrary variables such as organism name, chemical treatment etc. If there are no three parameters for any experiment data, then just define arbitrary variable and give a constant value to it. Here is what schema the datafile must follow.
						
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<strong>CSV:</strong> CSV format is easier to create using Microsoft Excel or Libre Office. The csv file must have following header<br><br>
							
							Compound, Group, X1_Y1_Z1, X1_Y1_Z2,....<br>
								A ,    b,     1.0,     2.0   .... <br>
								.<br>
								.<br>

							Here, X1_Y1_Z1 represents three variables as a single string which are tied together using underscore character. Each line in the csv file has a compound name, its group id for example whether the compound represents "I" (intracellular) or "E" (extracellular) molecule etc, and quantitative measurement for X, Y and Z variables. Except for first two column, the rest of the header does not need to be in any particular order as long as all of them are included. Generally biological experiments have control experiment which provides a way to compare and relate how certain perturbation has impacted the experimental results. This control dataset is also need to be included in the above both datafile formats and must be represented as "C" in the datafile as a variable that is varied during the experiment.

						Simple loading of a network and data file will allow users to visualize data on the network. By default, MINNO uses Control normalization, as mentioned below, for normalization. Users can change it through the Method menu, which offers multiple data normalization methods. Users can also assign a specific group to a certain set of nodes by first selecting nodes and then using the Assign Group menu to assign a specific group to them.

						<strong>Data Normalization:</strong> The data normalization methods appears in the "Method" drop down menu after datafile is loaded. MINNO allow user to define groups to different nodes of the network. Subsequently, data from the datafile will be expressed onto nodes as per their group defined by the user. Each group from the datafile can be treated individually depending on which method is suitable for them. Four normalization methods are provided by the tool:
						
						<ol>
							<li><strong>None:</strong> This method allow data values to be loaded and used as they are in the datafile onto the network nodes. No normalization method is implemented in this option.</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Control normalization:</strong> This method computes the standard deviation of the control dataset for each compound. Then it subtract the value measured in certain condition with the value in control case for each metabolite and specific time point and divide the difference with the standard deviation to get normalized value.
							<br><br>
							Let std_dev be the standard deviation of the control dataset. Then the normalized data can be obtained using below eq.<br><br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ny(t) = (y(t) – c(t))/std_dev <br><br>
							here Ny(t) is the normalized value of y(t) from Y dataset at time t when it is compared with the control value via c(t) at the same time.
							 </li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Control Mean normalization:</strong> This method computes the mean and standard deviation of the control dataset for each compound. Then it subtract the value measured in certain condition at specific time point and the mean value of the control dataset and divide the difference with the standard deviation to get normalized value.
							<br><br>
							
							Let c_mean and std_dev be the mean and standard deviation of the control dataset. Then the normalized data can be obtained using below eq. <br><br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ny(t) = (y(t) – c_mean)/std_dev <br><br>
							here Ny(t) is the normalized value of y(t) from Y dataset at time t when it is compared with the mean value of the control dataset C for all time point.
							
							</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong> Log2 fold change:</strong> This method computes log(y(t)/c(t)) value for Y dataset at time t with respect to control dataset c(t) at time point 't' for each compound.</li>
						</ol>

					<font face="Arial" size="3">
						<strong>Parameter:</strong> The scaling value essentially allow how much one unit difference in the normalization data would translate into node sizes. Scaling value >1 means that the 1 unit difference in the normalized data would translate into >1 unit difference in the node size. 
						
						<br><br>
						
						<strong>Assign Group:</strong> This menu contains options for different group that can be assigned to network nodes. To assign specific group to any node, one first need to select all nodes which belongs to the specific group such as intracellular or extracellular and then select the group from the Assign group drop-down menu. After assigning different groups to nodes, user can select the normalization method to each group and scale the values using scaling option.

									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Geometric Operations:</strong> 						
								<ul>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Alignment:</strong>
										<ul>
											<br>
											<li><strong>Horizontal:</strong> 
											Horizontal alignment of selected network elements. User can use this option to align selected nodes, rectangles or images used in the visualization.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li><strong>Vertical:</strong> 
											Vertical alignment of selected network elements. User can use this option to align selected nodes, rectangles or images used in the visualization.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li><strong>Circular:</strong> 
											Circular alignment of selected network elements. This form a equi-spaced ring. It is important to select network elements that user wants to appears as a ring.
											</li>
											<br>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Layers:</strong> 
										MINNO creates various svg elements and group them in classes. However, user may prefer to reorder these groups to built more appealing visualization. To do that, MINNO offers way to push different group at the top or bottom.  
										<br>
										<ul>
											<br>
											<li><strong>Bring to front:</strong> 
											Bring entire group of elements at the top.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li><strong>Push it back:</strong> 
											Pushes all the elements of the group at the bottom.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br>
										These options changes the order of groups but not the order of elements within individual group. This way user can push rectangle svg group at the bottom so that the network can be visualized on the top of it. However, when multiple rectangles are created, user need to manage how different rectangles will order themselves based on order of their creations. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> 
									This option allow user to make duplicates of selected network elements. Using this, certain part of the network can be duplicated and its nodes and links can be colored or change their size to highlight different group of data. This feature is basically to create a simplified network representation to compare different datasets.
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Rotation:</strong> 				
									Rotate selected network elements about their centeriod.		
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Make arcs:</strong> 						
									Make curved edges. For example, it makes nice curved edges for circular loops in the network.
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Remove arcs:</strong>
									Revert back curved edges to straight. 						
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Highlight:</strong>
									Change opacity to 1.0 to selected network elements. This feature also allow user to select which reactions will be selected to be included for the KGML file of the network. Only nodes and edges whose opacity is 1.0 will be included in the KGML file.						
									</li>
									<br>
									<li><strong>Un-Highlight:</strong> 					
									Change opacity to 0.5 to selected network elements. This feature also allow user to select which reactions will be selected to be included for the KGML file of the network. Nodes and edges whose opacity is 0.5 will be excluded in the KGML file.												
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Undo:</strong>
							It only undo nodes movements or dragging event by the user. If you delete or insert any network element, Undo cannot revert to the previous network. 
							</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Redo:</strong>
							It only redo nodes movements or dragging event by the user. If you delete or insert any network element, Undo cannot revert to the previous network.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Help:</strong>
							Opens up User Manual.
